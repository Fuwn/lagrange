# Release notes

## 1.2
* Help is opened on first run instead of the "About Lagrange" page to make it easier to discover important Gemini links like the FAQ.
* Added tab auto-reloading. Configure the reloading interval via the page context menu ("Set Auto-Reload..."). The interval is part of the persistent state of the tab.
* Added editable bookmark icons: use your favorite Unicode character as the symbol to represent a bookmarked site in Lagrange.
* Added search engine support: non-URL text entered in the navbar is passed onto the configured search query URL (Preferences > Network). An indicator is shown if a query will take place.
* Short pages are centered vertically on actual page content excluding the top banner.
* Added user preference for aligning all pages to the top of the window.
* Shift+Insert can be used for pasting clipboard contents into input fields.
* Added keybinding (F11) for toggling fullscreen mode. On macOS, the shortcut is ⌃⌘F as before.
* Added keybinding for finding text on page.
* "Go to Root" respects a user name found in the URL. One can still "Go to Parent" to get above the user level.
* Scroll position remains fixed while horizontally resizing the window or sidebars.
* Middle-clicking on links: open new tab in background or foreground depending on the Shift key.
* Feed entries are sorted by refresh time if they are published on the same date.
* Dialog buttons are aligned to the right edge, leaving room for additional action buttons on the left.
* Site icons use a different color in tab titles for visual distinction.
* Windows: Added a custom window frame to replace the default Windows one. This looks nicer but does not behave exactly like a native window frame. Added a setting to Preferences for switching back to the default frame.
* Windows: Fixed a flash of white when the window is first opened.
* Removed a strange violet-on-green color theme pairing.
* Fixed a crash when opening the audio player menu.

## 1.1.4
* Fixed feed entry highlight/read status issue in the sidebar.
* Fixed Gopher menu links that contain spaces.
* Fixed vertical alignment of short pages: top banner is excluded because it is not part of the content.

## 1.1.3
* Fixed crash when deleting a bookmark that was being used as a remote bookmark source.
* Fixed potential crash at shutdown.
* Fixed URL path decoding not respecting reserved characters.
* AppImage: Disable SSE 4.1 for improved compatibility.
* Windows: Fixed portable build so it stores user files under the "userdata" directory and not under AppData\Roaming\.

## 1.1.2
* Fixed potential crash at launch.
* Fixed input query from a background tab being applied to the foreground tab. An input query now forces a tab to the foreground.

* Fixed hover state not being cleared when right-clicking links.
* Fixed remote bookmarks not appearing if they lacked a user-friendly name on the source page.

## 1.1.1
* Fixed focus cycling inside dialogs. Widgets outside a dialog are not allowed to be focused.
* Fixed missing cursor in the New Identity "Valid until" field.
* Fixed "Import Links as Bookmarks" so it can be used to import local copies of remote bookmarks when viewing the remote source page.
* Fixed a cosmetic issue in the Import Identity dialog where part of the widget frames were not drawn.
* Fixed word wrapping issue in unread feed entry titles.
* Fixed opening a URI that contains a fragment in the default browser. The fragment is no longer omitted.
* Fixed default value for the Line Width setting.
* Linux: Check monitor DPI for UI scaling like on Windows and macOS.
* Allow reloading the same URL when clicking on a link or bookmark, or pressing Enter in the navbar.
* Bookmark URLs are normalized by removing the default Gemini port.
* Added a list of environment variables to "about:debug".
* XDG: Respect `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` environment variable for storing user files.

* The default set of bookmarks now uses a remote source.

## 1.1
* Added identity importing: existing client certificates in PEM format can be imported from the current page, from clipboard, or from drag-and-dropped files.
* Added setting for maximum cache size. This is the amount of fetched data kept in memory for page navigation and content lookup. The default is 10 MB.
* Added option to show full link URL when hovering on it.
